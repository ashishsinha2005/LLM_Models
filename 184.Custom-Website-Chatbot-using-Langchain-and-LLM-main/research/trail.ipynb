Here’s a breakdown of the key steps involved in building such a pipeline\\n\\n1. Data Acquisition\\n\\nThe first step is to gather relevant data for training. Data can come from various sources:\\n\\nAvailable Data: Structured files like CSV, text, PDF, DOCX, and XLSX formats.\\n\\nOther Data: Collected from APIs, databases, web scraping, or the internet.\\n\\nNo Data: If no data is available, it can be generated using LLMs (Large Language Models) like OpenAI’s GPT. For instance, by prompting models to generate sentences.\\n\\nData Augmentation:\\n\\nWhen the data volume is insufficient, augmentation techniques are applied to increase the dataset size artificially:\\n\\nSynonym Replacement: Substituting words with their synonyms. E.g., \"I am an AI Engineer\" → \"I am a Data Scientist.\"\\n\\nBigram Flip: Reordering phrases. E.g., \"I am Malavika\" → \"Malavika is my name.\"\\n\\nBack Translation: Translating a sentence to another language and back to the original. E.g., \"Data augmentation is the process of artificially generating new data\" translated to another language and back to English might become, \"Data mining is the process of routinely generating new data.\"\\n\\nAdding Noise:\\n\\nAdditional Data/Noise: Adding extra information or slight variations to existing sentences to create variations. E.g., \"I am an AI engineer. I love this job.\" → \"I love my job as an AI engineer\".\\n\\n2. Data Preparation/Preprocessing\\n\\nThis stage involves cleaning and preparing data for model input:\\n\\nBasic Preprocessing:\\n\\nTokenization: Splitting text into smaller units like words or sentences. Word Tokenization: \"My name is Malavika\" → [\\'My\\', \\'name\\', \\'is\\', \\'Malavika\\'] Sentence Tokenization: \"My name is Malavika. I am an AI engineer.\" → [\\'My name is Malavika\\', \\'I am an AI engineer\\']\\n\\nStemming: Reducing words to their base form (root). E.g., \"play, played, playing\" → \"play\"\\n\\nLemmatization: A more advanced version of stemming that returns readable root forms.\\n\\nPunctuation Removal: Removing unnecessary punctuation marks (e.g., /, ?).\\n\\nLowercase Conversion: Converting text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.\\n\\nLanguage Detection: Identifying the language of the text.\\n\\nAdvanced Preprocessing:\\n\\nPart-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Labeling words based on their grammatical roles.\\n\\nParsing Trees: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences.\\n\\nCoreference Resolution: Identifying which words refer to the same entities (e.g., resolving pronouns like \"he\" or \"it\").\\n\\n3. Feature Engineering\\n\\nTransforming raw text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.\\n\\nTF-IDF Vector: Measures word importance relative to a document and across a corpus.\\n\\nCount Vector: Counts the occurrences of words.\\n\\nHashing Vector: Uses hash functions to convert text to numerical representations.\\n\\nBag of Words: Represents text as a collection of words without considering order.\\n\\nOne-Hot Encoding: Represents individual words as binary vectors.\\n\\nTransformer Models: Advanced deep learning models like BERT or GPT to convert text into dense vectors.\\n\\nWord2Vec: Converts words into dense numerical vectors that capture semantic meanings.\\n\\n4. Modeling\\n\\nYou can either use open-source or paid models depending on the resources available.\\n\\nOpen-source LLM: These require infrastructure (CPU/GPU, memory) but can be run locally.\\n\\nPaid LLM (e.g., OpenAI): No infrastructure needed, just API integration.\\n\\n5. Evaluation\\n\\nEvaluation involves two aspects:\\n\\nIntrinsic Evaluation: Metrics evaluated by the generative AI engineer (e.g., perplexity, BLEU score, etc.).\\n\\nExtrinsic Evaluation: Feedback collected from users in real-world deployment.\\n\\n6. Deployment\\n\\nThis phase involves deploying the model to production. It requires setting up systems for continuous monitoring and periodic updates:\\n\\nMonitoring: Track the model\\'s performance, ensuring it meets desired metrics and outcomes.\\n\\nRetraining: Periodically retrain the model with new data or when performance degrades.\\n\\nCommon Terms:\\n\\nCorpus: The entire collection of sentences or texts used.\\n\\nVocabulary: Unique words present in the corpus.\\n\\nDocuments: Individual files (e.g., DOCX, PDF) containing text.\\n\\nWords: Single units of meaning arranged in order to create text.\\n\\nThis pipeline provides an end-to-end process for building generative AI systems, from gathering data to deploying the model and maintaining its performance.\\n\\nIn the next document, we will focus on the data preprocessing stage of the pipeline with a hands-on demonstration. Here’s a glimpse of what will be covered:\\n\\nHandling Missing Data\\n\\nText Cleaning\\n\\nFeature Engineering\\n\\nThis hands-on guide will provide step-by-step instructions for cleaning and preparing your data before feeding it into the generative model.\\n\\nThis document outlines the key steps in a Generative AI pipeline, setting the stage for hands-on preprocessing in the following section. Stay tuned for the next part where we will dive deep into transforming raw data into a suitable format for training models.\\n\\nLike\\n\\nComment\\n\\n3 1 Comment\\n\\nAladdin alradhi\\n\\nProfessor at Sheridan College: Cyber Security, IPV6 Hall of fame Winner, AWS/Azure/GCP Clouds, AI/Data Science, AI Educator; Trainer, Public Speaker and mentor\\n\\n1mo\\n\\nReport this comment\\n\\nMalavika Gowthaman .

Below are common text preprocessing techniques used to prepare data for generative AI models:\\n\\n1. Lowercase Conversion\\n\\nConvert the entire text to lowercase to maintain uniformity and avoid treating the same word with different capitalizations as distinct tokens.\\n\\n2. Removing HTML Tags\\n\\nText scraped from the web often contains HTML tags, which are unnecessary for NLP tasks. These tags can be removed using libraries like BeautifulSoup.\\n\\n3. Removing URLs\\n\\nURLs in the text can distract the model from understanding the core content. Regular expressions can be used to identify and remove them.\\n\\n4. Punctuation Handling\\n\\nDepending on the task, punctuation can either be removed or retained. For instance, punctuation may be useful in sentiment analysis but can be discarded for tasks like language generation.\\n\\nOther ways to Handle Punctuation:\\n\\n5. Handling Chat Conversations\\n\\nChat-based data requires additional steps, such as separating speaker turns, removing time stamps, and normalizing abbreviations or casual language.\\n\\n6. Handling Incorrect Text with TextBlob\\n\\nIn text preprocessing, handling incorrect words is crucial, especially when dealing with user-generated content, typos, or misspellings. A common approach is using the library, which offers a simple method for correcting text.\\n\\n7. Stopword Removal\\n\\nStopwords like \"the,\" \"is,\" and \"in\" are common words that add little value. Removing them helps the model focus on more meaningful words.\\n\\n8. Removing Emojis\\n\\nEmojis can interfere with model predictions. A regular expression can be used to remove them from the text, ensuring a cleaner input.\\n\\n9. Tokenization\\n\\nTokenization involves splitting text into words or subwords. Several methods can be used:\\n\\nBasic split: Splits words based on spaces.\\n\\nRegular expressions: Handles more complex cases of token splitting.\\n\\nNLTK: Offers built-in functions for tokenizing text.\\n\\nspaCy: Provides robust tokenization and linguistic features.\\n\\n10. Stemming\\n\\nStemming reduces words to their base form (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"run\"). While this improves processing speed, the resulting words may not be fully readable.\\n\\n11. Lemmatization\\n\\nLemmatization is a more advanced method of getting the root form of a word while keeping it readable. For example, \"better\" becomes \"good.\" This is slower than stemming but provides more accurate results.\\n\\nKey Differences Between Stemming and Lemmatization:\\n\\nStemming: Fast but produces non-readable words (e.g., \"studying\" → \"studi\").\\n\\nLemmatization: Slow but returns readable root words (e.g., \"studying\" → \"study\").\\n\\nBy applying these text preprocessing techniques, the input data becomes clean, structured, and ready to deliver more accurate results when used in a Generative AI model.\\n\\nLike\\n\\nComment\\n\\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\\n\\nMore articles by this author\\n\\nNo more previous content\\n\\nEnd to End Pipeline of Generative AI\\n\\nOct 18, 2024\\n\\nIntroduction to Gen AI\\n\\nOct 17, 2024\\n\\nNo more next content\\n\\nSign in\\n\\nStay updated on your professional world\\n\\nSign in\\n\\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.\\n\\nNew to LinkedIn?

Below are common text preprocessing techniques used to prepare data for generative AI models:\\n1. Lowercase Conversion\\nConvert the entire text to lowercase to maintain uniformity and avoid treating the same word with different capitalizations as distinct tokens.\\n2. Removing HTML Tags\\nText scraped from the web often contains HTML tags, which are unnecessary for NLP tasks. These tags can be removed using libraries like BeautifulSoup.\\n3. Removing URLs'),\n",

Removing URLs\\nURLs in the text can distract the model from understanding the core content. Regular expressions can be used to identify and remove them.\\n4. Punctuation Handling\\nDepending on the task, punctuation can either be removed or retained. For instance, punctuation may be useful in sentiment analysis but can be discarded for tasks like language generation.\\nOther ways to Handle Punctuation:\\n5. Handling Chat Conversations\\nChat-based data requires additional steps, such as separating speaker turns, removing time stamps, and normalizing abbreviations or casual language.\\n6. Handling Incorrect Text with TextBlob\\nIn text preprocessing, handling incorrect words is crucial, especially when dealing with user-generated content, typos, or misspellings. A common approach is using the library, which offers a simple method for correcting text.\\n7. Stopword Removal'),\n",

Stopword Removal\\nStopwords like \"the,\" \"is,\" and \"in\" are common words that add little value. Removing them helps the model focus on more meaningful words.\\n8. Removing Emojis\\nEmojis can interfere with model predictions. A regular expression can be used to remove them from the text, ensuring a cleaner input.\\n9. Tokenization\\nTokenization involves splitting text into words or subwords. Several methods can be used:\\nBasic split: Splits words based on spaces.\\nRegular expressions: Handles more complex cases of token splitting.\\nNLTK: Offers built-in functions for tokenizing text.\\nspaCy: Provides robust tokenization and linguistic features.\\n10. Stemming\\nStemming reduces words to their base form (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"run\"). While this improves processing speed, the resulting words may not be fully readable.\\n11. Lemmatization'),\n",

Lemmatization\\nLemmatization is a more advanced method of getting the root form of a word while keeping it readable. For example, \"better\" becomes \"good.\" This is slower than stemming but provides more accurate results.\\nKey Differences Between Stemming and Lemmatization:\\nStemming: Fast but produces non-readable words (e.g., \"studying\" → \"studi\").\\nLemmatization: Slow but returns readable root words (e.g., \"studying\" → \"study\").\\nBy applying these text preprocessing techniques, the input data becomes clean, structured, and ready to deliver more accurate results when used in a Generative AI model.\\nLike\\nComment\\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\\nMore articles by this author\\nNo more previous content\\nEnd to End Pipeline of Generative AI\\nOct 18, 2024\\nIntroduction to Gen AI\\nOct 17, 2024\\nNo more next content\\nSign in\\nStay updated on your professional world\\nSign in\\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.'),\n",

## Resource Scheduling Using Reinforcement Learning

## Situation:

- Business faced challenges with inefficient resource allocation, resulting in underutilized capacity and escalating operational costs.
- These inefficiencies caused delays in project timelines and reduced overall productivity.

## Task:

- The objective was to design a system that optimizes resource scheduling, ensuring better utilization while reducing associated costs.  
- This system needed to dynamically adapt to varying workloads and demands in real-time.



## Action:

- Developed reinforcement learning-based agents leveraging algorithms like Deep Q-Learning and actor-critic methods. 
-   Implemented and trained these models using PyTorch to optimize resource distribution and streamline scheduling operations effectively.

## Result:
-  The solution improved resource utilization by 25%, enabling more efficient allocation of workloads. 
- Additionally, it reduced operational expenses by 15%, leading to faster project deliveries and enhanced service quality.
